# General Description

Robert Bosch is the world market leader for pressure sensors in automotive and consumer
applications. Bosch’s proprietary APSM (Advanced Porous Silicon Membrane) MEMS
manufacturing process is fully CMOS compatible and allows a hermetic sealing of the cavity in
an all silicon process. The BMP280 is based on Bosch’s proven Piezo-resistive pressure sensor
technology featuring high EMC robustness, high accuracy and linearity and long term stability.
The BMP280 is an absolute barometric pressure sensor especially designed for mobile
applications. The sensor module is housed in an extremely compact 8-pin metal-lid LGA
package with a footprint of only 2.0 × 2.5 mm2 and 0.95 mm package height. Its small
dimensions and its low power consumption of 2.7 µA @1Hz allow the implementation in battery
driven devices such as mobile phones, GPS modules or watches.
As the successor to the widely adopted BMP180, the BMP280 delivers high performance in all
applications that require precise pressure measurement. The BMP280 operates at lower noise,
supports new filter modes and an SPI interface within a footprint 63% smaller than the BMP180.
The emerging applications of in-door navigation, health care as well as GPS refinement require
a high relative accuracy and a low TCO at the same time. BMP180 and BMP280 are perfectly
suitable for applications like floor detection since both sensors feature excellent relative
accuracy is ±0.12 hPa, which is equivalent to ±1 m difference in altitude. The very low offset
temperature coefficient (TCO) of 1.5 Pa/K translates to a temperature drift of only 12.6 cm/K.

packages enhancing the calculation of the altitude given by the BMP280 pressure reading.
