# MVP Plan: PDF Datasheet Content Extractor

## Core Concept
Build a system that uses a **section-by-section iterative method** where Tree (structure generation) and Fill (content population) are intertwined, not separate phases. Both use hybrid approaches combining pdfplumber and OpenAI native PDF capabilities.

## Key Principles from Scope
- **Hybrid Iterative Method**: Simultaneously refine structure AND extract content
- **Section-by-Section**: Process document incrementally to manage context windows
- **Structure matches actual content**: No orphaned files or missing content
- **More small files is better**: Each file should contain 1-2 sections max

## MVP Architecture

### Phase 1: Enhanced Tree Generation
**Goal**: Improve current `main.py` approach with hybrid methodology

**Hybrid Approach for Tree**:
- **OpenAI Native PDF**: Primary tool for understanding document semantics, section hierarchies, and logical relationships
- **pdfplumber**: Fallback for handling complex layouts, extracting precise section headers, and validating structure against actual text

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Enhance existing prompt in `main.py` for better tree generation
2. Add JSON validation and error handling 
3. Add pdfplumber integration for section header validation
4. Create simple state persistence (save tree structure as JSON)
5. Test and refine with BMP280 datasheet

### Phase 2: Minimal State Management
**Goal**: Enable iterative processing with memory between sections

**Requirements**:
- Save generated tree structure to disk
- Track processing progress (which sections completed)
- Store cross-references and dependencies between sections
- Simple configuration management

**Implementation**:
- JSON state file for tree structure and progress
- Basic logging for debugging iterative process
- Configuration file for API keys and processing parameters

### Phase 3: Content Population (Fill)
**Goal**: Implement section-by-section content extraction into generated structure

**Hybrid Approach for Fill**:
- **OpenAI Native PDF**: Primary for content understanding, organization, and markdown formatting
- **pdfplumber**: Specialized for table extraction, structured data, and handling edge cases where native parsing struggles

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create section-by-section content extraction pipeline
2. Implement conversation state management for iterative processing
3. Add markdown formatting and table preservation
4. Build file generation system that creates actual directory/file structure
5. Add basic content validation and completeness checks

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
**Goal**: End-to-end workflow validation

**Tasks**:
1. Connect tree generation with content population
2. Test complete workflow with BMP280 datasheet
3. Manual review of output quality and organization
4. Identify and fix common failure modes
5. Validate generalizability with one additional datasheet type

## Technical Stack

## Success Criteria for MVP

1. **Tree Generation**: Successfully creates logical, hierarchical structure for BMP280 datasheet
2. **Content Population**: Extracts and organizes content into small, focused markdown files
3. **State Management**: Can resume processing from interruption points
4. **Hybrid Integration**: Effectively uses both pdfplumber and OpenAI native capabilities
5. **Generalizability**: Works with at least one other datasheet type
6. **Output Quality**: Produces AI-readable content with preserved technical information

## Testing Strategy

### Primary Test Case: BMP280 Datasheet
- Well-known document with clear structure
- Mix of text, tables, and technical specifications
- Good representative of typical hardware datasheets

### Secondary Validation
- One additional datasheet from different manufacturer
- Focus on structural differences and edge cases
- Validate that hybrid approach handles variations

## Key Decisions & Trade-offs

### Hybrid vs Pure Approaches
- **Decision**: Use hybrid pdfplumber + OpenAI for both Tree and Fill
- **Rationale**: Leverages strengths of each - AI for semantics, pdfplumber for precision
- **Trade-off**: More complexity but better robustness

### Intertwined vs Sequential Processing
- **Decision**: Section-by-section iterative method (Tree + Fill together)
- **Rationale**: Ensures structure matches actual content availability
- **Trade-off**: More complex state management but higher quality output

### State Management Complexity
- **Decision**: Minimal state management for MVP
- **Rationale**: Focus on core functionality, avoid over-engineering
- **Trade-off**: May need refactoring for larger documents later

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Cost optimization and token usage monitoring
- Support for larger documents with better memory management
- Template-based processing for common datasheet patterns
- Diagram extraction and processing
- Enhanced error resilience and retry logic
- Performance optimization for batch processing

## Risk Mitigation
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement basic rate limiting and retry logic
- **Context Window Limits**: Section-by-section processing keeps chunks manageable
- **PDF Parsing Edge Cases**: Hybrid approach provides fallback options
- **Cost Management**: Start with single document testing, monitor token usage
