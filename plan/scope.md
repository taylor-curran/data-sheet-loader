# Project Scope: PDF Datasheet Content Extractor

## Goal
Build a generalizable system that takes hardware datasheet PDFs and automatically extracts content into well-organized directory/file structures for AI consumption and analysis. The resulting files need to be short and focused on a single topic. IMPORTANT: More small files is better than less large files!!

## Key Requirements
- **Input**: Hardware datasheet PDFs (starting with BMP280, generalizable to other datasheets)
- **Output**: Organized directory structure with markdown files containing extracted content
- **Primary Use Case**: AI-readable content organization (formatting helps AI understanding but human readability is secondary)
- **Generalizability**: System should work across different datasheet types and manufacturers

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Input format: PDFs only (hardware datasheets are almost always PDFs)
- Human-in-the-loop: Manual intervention is acceptable and expected
- Content fidelity: Preserve information and basic formatting, but not crucial for perfect visual reproduction
- Tables and structured data should be preserved in markdown format where possible
- Diagrams will be addressed in future iterations (not MVP focus)

## Approach: Hybrid Iterative Method

### Overview
Rather than tree-first or integrated approaches, use a section-by-section iterative method that maintains organizational quality while ensuring content alignment.

### Process Flow
1. **Rough Structure First**: Generate high-level organizational structure
2. **Section-by-Section Refinement**: For each major section:
   - Simultaneously refine structure AND extract content
   - Maintain thoughtful organization at each level
   - Ensure structure matches actual content availability
3. **Iterative Depth**: Go deeper level by level to manage context windows

### Benefits of This Approach
- **Thoughtful organization at each level**: Quality doesn't degrade with document length
- **Structure matches actual content**: No orphaned files or missing content
- **Manageable context windows**: Avoids overwhelming the AI with too much context
- **Human review points**: Natural checkpoints for manual intervention

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Non-LLM Based Population (Cheaper Alternative)
- **Section Header Detection + Mapping**: Use OCR/text extraction to identify section headers, create mapping between detected headers and file paths
- **Page-by-Page Analysis**: Process PDF page by page with rule-based classification
- **Template-Based Extraction**: Use known datasheet patterns for content classification
- **Pros**: Much cheaper, more deterministic, faster processing
- **Cons**: Less flexible, requires manual template creation, may miss nuanced content relationships
- **Future Consideration**: Could be implemented as a cost-optimization after proving the AI approach

## Technical Considerations
- Use `pdfplumber` for text extraction (better table handling than PyPDF2)
- **OpenAI Responses API**: Use Responses API instead of Chat Completions for better structured output handling and multi-step workflows
- **Conversation State Management**: Maintain state across iterative section processing to remember:
  - Previously processed sections and their assigned file locations
  - Evolving directory structure as we go deeper
  - Cross-references and dependencies between sections
- AI-powered content classification for chunk-to-file mapping
- Flexible handling of JSON structure variations between runs
- Paragraph-by-paragraph processing with sliding window context
- Modular design to allow switching between AI and rule-based approaches

## Success Criteria for MVP
- Successfully extracts and organizes content from BMP280 or similar datasheet
- Creates coherent directory structure with appropriate file organization
- Preserves key technical information (specifications, procedures, etc.)
- Produces AI-readable markdown files
- Maintains quality organization throughout the document
- Demonstrates generalizability potential with at least one other datasheet type

## Future Enhancements
- Diagram extraction and processing
- Support for other document formats
- Reduced human intervention requirements
- Template-based processing for common datasheet patterns
- Cost optimization through hybrid AI/rule-based approaches

## Potential Later Considerations
- **Cost Management**: Token usage monitoring, rate limiting, cost estimation
- **Error Resilience**: PDF parsing edge cases, API retry logic, partial progress saving
- **Quality Validation**: Structure validation, content completeness checks, cross-reference preservation
- **Testing Strategy**: Ground truth creation, iterative prompt refinement
- **Security**: Data privacy, API data handling, proprietary content protection
